        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology and Political ScienceðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a third year Sociology and Political Science major at Univeristy of California, Riverside. I chose those two majors because I have always been interested in how people function. I was more interested in their societal functionalism not the scientific part. Studying sociology helps me understand how different and how similar they are based on their religion, culture, family dynamics, and more. I have also been interested in politics and lawmaking. I like to know what goes on in other countries and how their laws come to be. These laws are the reasons the political system is the way it is and understanding that helps me understand how a nation function. These laws also reveal what the country holds as a principle. <br><br>
        I like to listen to music and take pictures. These two hobbies have helped me keep a balance between my education and my nonacademic interests. Listening to music inspires me and it also helps me with stress. I believe that music is so powerful, and I can actually use it with my education at times. Studying sociology means studying different societies and different cultures. Listening to the music of whatever society or culture I am studying helps me understand the dynamics of that group. Music is used with politics as well. Many societies express the things they go through music. Many revolutions and political unrest were represented through music. Taking pictures on the other hand helps me capture all the things I am interested in. Whether it is scenes of music, people in groups, or a political movement, the picture speaks for itself. I can capture my interests in a single frame.<br><br>
        I have gained some professional experience in the field of sociology through my work with a church organization that I am involved in. In this organization, we plan summer camps for children and youth. We create training programs for the people that will be responsible for these children. In these training programs, we teach about the different familial backgrounds that children can come from. We explain how children can have different socioeconomic factors, cultures, and principles. As a sociology major, I help with explaining what the best way is to deal with children from different backgrounds. It is important to have the proper techniques and understanding for these children. If the children are understood as their own unique persons, we can help them get socialized in the way that fits them.
For my political science experience, I have gained some professional experience by participating in election day. Understanding the election process is important as a political science major and it is always studied. On election day, I was a participant in helping others cast their votes. I helped hand out ballots and explaining what they need to do. This experience was a firsthand experience in the things I study.
